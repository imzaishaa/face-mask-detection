# face-mask-detection
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in an image. It includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix), and real-time predictions using a dataset from Kaggle.
